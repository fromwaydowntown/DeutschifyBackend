## üîç Backend Logic Overview

The backend of DeutschifyTelegram is designed to efficiently process NBA news articles and adapt them into A1-level German for language learners. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

### 1. **User Request**
- When a user accesses the application, they can request the latest NBA news articles through the frontend interface.
- The request is sent to the FastAPI backend via a RESTful API endpoint.

### 2. **Fetching NBA News**
- The backend retrieves the latest NBA news articles from a reliable sports news API or database.
- This can involve making an HTTP request to an external API that provides real-time sports news.

### 3. **Text Processing**
- Once the articles are fetched, the backend processes the text to prepare it for adaptation. This involves:
  - **Cleaning the Text**: Removing any unnecessary HTML tags, advertisements, or irrelevant content.
  - **Extracting Key Information**: Identifying the main points of the articles that are relevant for adaptation.

### 4. **AI-Powered Adaptation**
- The core of the adaptation process involves using the OpenAI API:
  - The cleaned and extracted text is sent to the OpenAI API with specific instructions to adapt the content to A1-level German.
  - The API utilizes natural language processing to simplify complex sentences, replace difficult vocabulary with simpler alternatives, and ensure that the overall message remains intact while being accessible to A1 learners.

### 5. **Receiving Adapted Text**
- The backend receives the adapted text from the OpenAI API.
- This adapted content is then formatted and prepared for delivery back to the user.

### 6. **Response to User**
- The backend sends the adapted A1-level German text back to the frontend as a JSON response.
- The frontend then displays the adapted articles to the user, allowing them to read and engage with the content.

### 7. **Additional Features**
- **Text-to-Speech**: Users can listen to the adapted articles using the text-to-speech feature, which is integrated into the frontend.
- **Learning Support**: The backend can also provide additional resources, such as vocabulary lists and comprehension exercises, based on the adapted text.
